# Availity
Need to  unzip library "commons-csv-1.9.0-bin.zip" and add jar "commons-csv-1.9.0.jar" to the build path.
Also, the Availity.csv needs to be present in the exercise2 path for it to run  exercise 2.  Particularly, I include three major insurance companies as data samples:


A.Humana
B.Aetna
C.Cigna

After running exercise two, there should be three csv files.  One for each insurance company.
1. humana.csv
2. aetna.csv
3. cigna.csv

All three files shouldn't have any duplicate userIds.
