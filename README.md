# Availity
Need to  unzip library "commons-csv-1.9.0-bin.zip" and add jar "commons-csv-1.9.0.jar" to the build path.
Also, the Availity.csv needs to be present in the exercise2 path for it to run  exercise 2.  Particularly, I include three major insurance companies as data samples:
1.Humana
2.Aetna
3.Cigna

After running exercise two, there should be three csv files.  One for each insurance company.
humana.csv
aetna.csv
cigna.csv

All three files shouldn't have any duplicate userIds.
